Welcome to my daily code laboratory! This repository is a living record of my problem-solving journey on LeetCode. 

### 🤖 How it Works
To maintain a streak of consistency, I use a **custom Bash script** and **Windows Task Scheduler** to push one solved problem from my local machine to this repository every single day. 

### 📂 Folder Structure
Each folder is named by the problem number and title for easy navigation:
- `[Problem_No.] [Problem_Title]`
  - `code.cpp` (The logic)
  - `optmize.cpp` (optmization of solution) but not all problems 

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Environment:** MinGW / GCC
